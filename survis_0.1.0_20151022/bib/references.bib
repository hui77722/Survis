  abstract = {During the last years, water quality has been threatened by various pollutants. Therefore, modeling and predicting water quality
  have become very important in controlling water pollution. In this work, advanced artificial intelligence (AI) algorithms are
  developed to predict water quality index (WQI) and water quality classification (WQC). For the WQI prediction, artificial
  neural network models, namely nonlinear autoregressive neural network (NARNET) and long short-term memory (LSTM) deep
  learning algorithm, have been developed. In addition, three machine learning algorithms, namely, support vector machine
  (SVM), K-nearest neighbor (K-NN), and Naive Bayes, have been used for the WQC forecasting. The used dataset has 7
  significant parameters, and the developed models were evaluated based on some statistical parameters. The results revealed that
  the proposed models can accurately predict WQI and classify the water quality according to superior robustness. Prediction
  results demonstrated that the NARNET model performed slightly better than the LSTM for the prediction of the WQI values
  and the SVM algorithm has achieved the highest accuracy (97.01%) for the WQC prediction. Furthermore, the NARNET and
  LSTM models have achieved similar accuracy for the testing phase with a slight difference in the regression coefficient
  (RNARNET = 96:17% and RLSTM = 94:21%). This kind of promising research can contribute significantly to water management.},

@article{Ooi2021Bod5,
  abstract = {Biological oxygen demand (BOD5) is an indicator used to monitor water quality. However, the standard process of measuring BOD5 is time consuming and could delay crucial mitigation works in the event of pollution. To solve this problem, this study employed multiple machine learning
  (ML) methods such as random forest (RF), support vector regression (SVR) and multilayer perceptron (MLP) to train a best model that can accurately predict the BOD5 values in water samples based on other physical and chemical properties of the water. The training parameters were
  optimized using genetic algorithm (GA) and feature selection was made using the sequential feature selection (SFS) method. The proposed
  machine learning framework was first tested on a public dataset (Waterbase). The MLP method produced the best model, with an R2 score of
  0.7672791942775417, relative mean squared error (MSE) and relative mean absolute error (MAE) of approximately 15%. Feature importance calculations indicated that chemical oxygen demand (CODCr), ammonium and nitrate are features that highly correlate to BOD5. In the field study
  with a small private dataset consisting of water samples collected from two different lakes in Jiangsu Province of China, the trained model was
  found to have a similar range of prediction error (around 15%), a similar relative MAE (around 14%) and achieved about 6% better relative RMSE.},

  quality classification (WQC). Furthermore, the ANFIS model accurately predicted WQI, and the
  FFNN model showed superior robustness in classifying the WQC. In addition, the ANFIS model

  Prediction of water quality is an important tool for controlling and reducing water pollution.
  By employing superior big data processing ability of deep learning it is possible to improve the
  accuracy of prediction. This paper proposes a method for predicting water quality based on the
  deep belief network (DBN) model. First, the particle swarm optimization (PSO) algorithm is used
  to optimize the network parameters of the deep belief network, which is to extract feature vectors
  of water quality time series data at multiple scales. Then, combined with the least squares support
  vector regression (LSSVR) machine which is taken as the top prediction layer of the model, a new
  water quality prediction model referred to as PSO-DBN-LSSVR is put forward. The developed model
  is valued in terms of the mean absolute error (MAE), the mean absolute percentage error (MAPE),
  the root mean square error (RMSE), and the coefficient of determination (R
  2). Results illustrate that the model proposed in this paper can accurately predict water quality parameters and better
  robustness of water quality parameters compared with the traditional back propagation (BP) neural
  network, LSSVR, the DBN neural network, and the DBN-LSSVR combined model.},

  abstract = {Monitoring water quality is essential for protecting human health and the environment and controlling water quality. Artificial Intelligence (AI) offers significant opportunities to help improve the classification and prediction of water quality (WQ). In this study, various AI algorithms are assessed to handle WQ data collected over an extended period and develop a dependable approach for forecasting water quality as accurately as possible. Specifically, various machine learning classifiers and their stacking ensemble models were used to classify the WQ data via the Water Quality Index (WQI). The studied classifiers included Support Vector Machine (SVM), Random Forest (RF), Logistic Regression (LR), Decision Tree (DT), CATBoost, XGBoost, and Multilayer Perceptron (MLP). The dataset used in the study included 1679 samples and their meta-data collected over nine years. In addition, precision-recall curves and Receiver Operating Characteristic curves (ROC) were used to assess the performance of the various classifiers. The findings revealed that the CATBoost model offered the most accurate classifier with a percentage of 94.51. Moreover, after applying stacking ensemble models with all classifiers, accuracy reached 100% in various Meta-classifiers. Furthermore, the CATBoost achieved the highest accuracy as a primary gradient boosting algorithm and a meta classifier. Therefore, the boosting algorithm is proposed as a reliable approach for the WQ classification. The analysis presented in this article presents a framework that can support the efforts of researchers working toward water quality improvement using artificial intelligence.},

@article{Ahmed2019Efficient,
  abstract = {Water makes up about 70% of the earth’s surface and is one of the most important sources vital to sustaining life. Rapid urbanization and industrialization have led to a deterioration of water quality at an alarming rate, resulting in harrowing diseases. Water quality has been conventionally estimated through expensive and time-consuming lab and statistical analyses, which render the contemporary notion of real-time monitoring moot. The alarming consequences of poor water quality necessitate an alternative method, which is quicker and inexpensive. With this motivation, this research explores a series of supervised machine learning algorithms to estimate the water quality index (WQI), which is a singular index to describe the general quality of water, and the water quality class (WQC), which is a distinctive class defined on the basis of the WQI. The proposed methodology employs four input parameters, namely, temperature, turbidity, pH and total dissolved solids. Of all the employed algorithms, gradient boosting, with a learning rate of 0.1 and polynomial regression, with a degree of 2, predict the WQI most efficiently, having a mean absolute error (MAE) of 1.9642 and 2.7273, respectively. Whereas multi-layer perceptron (MLP), with a configuration of (3, 7), classifies the WQC most efficiently, with an accuracy of 0.8507. The proposed methodology achieves reasonable accuracy using a minimal number of parameters to validate the possibility of its use in real time water quality detection systems.},

@article{Bui2020Improving,
  abstract = {River water quality assessment is one of the most important tasks to enhance water resources management plans. A water quality index (WQI) considers several water quality variables simultaneously. Traditionally WQI calculations consume time and are often fraught with errors during derivations of sub-indices. In this study, 4 standalone (random forest (RF), M5P, random tree (RT), and reduced error pruning tree (REPT)) and 12 hybrid data-mining algorithms (combinations of standalones with bagging (BA), CV parameter selection (CVPS) and randomizable filtered classification (RFC)) were used to create Iran WQI (IRWQIsc) predictions. Six years (2012 to 2018) of monthly data from two water quality monitoring stations within the Talar catchment were compiled. Using Pearson correlation coefficients, 10 different input combinations were constructed. The data were divided into two groups (ratio 70:30) for model building (training dataset) and model validation (testing dataset) using a 10-fold cross-validation technique. The models were evaluated using several statistical and visual evaluation metrics. Result show that fecal coliform (FC) and total solids (TS) had the greatest and least effect on the prediction of IRWQIsc. The best input combinations varied among the algorithms; generally variables with very low correlations displayed weaker performance. Hybrid algorithms improved the prediction power of several of the standalone models, but not all. Hybrid BA-RT outperformed the other models (R2 = 0.941, RMSE = 2.71, MAE = 1.87, NSE = 0.941, PBIAS = 0.500). PBIAS indicated that all algorithms, with the exceptions of RT, BA-RT and CVPS-REPT, overestimated WQI values.},

@article{Lu2020Hybrid,
  abstract = {Water resources are the foundation of people’s life and economic development, and are closely related to health and the environment. Accurate prediction of water quality is the key to improving water management and pollution control. In this paper, two novel hybrid decision tree-based machine learning models are proposed to obtain more accurate short-term water quality prediction results. The basic models of the two hybrid models are extreme gradient boosting (XGBoost) and random forest (RF), which respectively introduce an advanced data denoising technique - complete ensemble empirical mode decomposition with adaptive noise (CEEMDAN). Taking the water resources of Gales Creek site in Tualatin River (one of the most polluted rivers in the world) Basin as an example, a total of 1875 data (hourly data) from May 1, 2019 to July 20, 2019 are collected. Two hybrid models are used to predict six water quality indicators, including water temperature, dissolved oxygen, pH value, specific conductance, turbidity, and fluorescent dissolved organic matter. Six error metrics are introduced as the basis of performance evaluation, and the results of the two models are compared with the other four conventional models. The results reveal that: (1) CEEMDAN-RF performs best in the prediction of temperature, dissolved oxygen and specific conductance, the mean absolute percentage errors (MAPEs) are 0.69%, 1.05%, and 0.90%, respectively. CEEMDAN-XGBoost performs best in the prediction of pH value, turbidity, and fluorescent dissolved organic matter, the MAPEs are 0.27%, 14.94%, and 1.59%, respectively. (2) The average MAPEs of CEEMDAN-RF and CEEMMDAN-XGBoost models are the smallest, which are 3.90% and 3.71% respectively, indicating that their overall prediction performance is the best. In addition, the stability of the prediction model is also discussed in this paper. The analysis shows that the prediction stability of CEEMDAN-RF and CEEMDAN-XGBoost is higher than other benchmark models.},

@article{Najahahmed2019Machine,
    abstract = {In any aquatic system analysis, the modelling water quality   parameters are of considerable significance. The traditional modelling methodologies are dependent on datasets that involve large amount of unknown or unspecified input data and generally consist of time-consuming processes. The implementation of artificial intelligence (AI) leads to a flexible mathematical structure that has the capability to identify non-linear and complex relationships between input and output data. There has been a major degradation of the Johor River Basin because of several developmental and human activities. Therefore, setting up of a water quality prediction model for better water resource management is of critical importance and will serve as a powerful tool. The different modelling approaches that have been implemented include: Adaptive Neuro-Fuzzy Inference System (ANFIS), Radial Basis Function Neural Networks (RBF-ANN), and Multi-Layer Perceptron Neural Networks (MLP-ANN). However, data obtained from monitoring stations and experiments are possibly polluted by noise signals as a result of random and systematic errors. Due to the presence of noise in the data, it is relatively difficult to make an accurate prediction. Hence, a Neuro-Fuzzy Inference System (WDT-ANFIS) based augmented wavelet de-noising technique has been recommended that depends on historical data of the water quality parameter. In the domain of interests, the water quality parameters primarily include ammoniacal nitrogen (AN), suspended solid (SS) and pH. In order to evaluate the impacts on the model, three evaluation techniques or assessment processes have been used. The first assessment process is dependent on the partitioning of the neural network connection weights that ascertains the significance of every input parameter in the network. On the other hand, the second and third assessment processes ascertain the most effectual input that has the potential to construct the models using a single and a combination of parameters, respectively. During these processes, two scenarios were introduced: Scenario 1 and Scenario 2. Scenario 1 constructs a prediction model for water quality parameters at every station, while Scenario 2 develops a prediction model on the basis of the value of the same parameter at the previous station (upstream). Both the scenarios are based on the value of the twelve input parameters. The field data from 2009 to 2010 was used to validate WDT-ANFIS. The WDT-ANFIS model exhibited a significant improvement in predicting accuracy for all the water quality parameters and outperformed all the recommended models. Also, the performance of Scenario 2 was observed to be more adequate than Scenario 1, with substantial improvement in the range of 0.5% to 5% for all the water quality parameters at all stations. On validating the recommended model, it was found that the model satisfactorily predicted all the water quality parameters (R2 values equal or bigger than 0.9).},
